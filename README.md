# FiveM-UI
This is for FiveM and is a UI located next to the map. You can change the colors of the text but it is a little confusing if you have limited/no knowledge of Lua. This is my first public project so please bare with me, if you have any questions or ways to improve this code, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. You can reach out to me by Discord at Jackson K.#9146. I would recommend the street labels script made by codibez as this was made to be used with it. 
You can find streetlabel at https://github.com/codibez/streetlabel
I would also recommend the nearest postal script by DevBlocky - https://github.com/DevBlocky/nearest-postal


FiveM-UI includes two slash commands that work with the UI
/bday   - Use this to show your birthday on the Birthday part of the UI
/charname    - Use this to change your characters name in the Name part of the UI
There is also a "ID" part of the UI which automatically shows the persons server ID-please note that I have not been able to test this fully so it might not work.

Please take into consideration that this is my first project so it will more than likely need improving
