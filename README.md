# FiveM-UI
This is for FiveM and is a UI located next to the map. You can change the colors but it is a little confusing if you have limited/no knowledge of Lua. This is my first public project so please bare with me, if you have any questions or ways to improve this code, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.
